# Product Mission (Lite)

Goblinstadt Ressourcen Manager is a mobile-first Progressive Web App that helps Goblinstadt players track and manage their character resources during gameplay by providing an intuitive, offline-capable interface optimized for live-action RPG sessions.

Designed for children and families playing the Goblinstadt interactive RPG in Hamburg, this offline-first PWA provides visual stack representations with color-coded remainders that make resource tracking instant and intuitive during active gameplay. Unlike generic counter apps, our game-specific interface with Service Worker caching ensures 100% offline functionality and zero data loss in venue areas with poor connectivity.
