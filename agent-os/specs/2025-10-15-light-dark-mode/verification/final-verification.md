## 9. Browser Compatibility

### Testing Notes

Full browser testing was not performed via automated tools (Playwright not available), however code review confirms:

**Supported Features:**
- `window.matchMedia` API (widely supported, with fallback)
- `localStorage` API (universally supported)
- CSS custom properties (modern browser requirement already established)
- CSS transitions (universally supported)
- Native button elements (universally supported)

**Graceful Degradation:**
- `window.matchMedia` check safely fails for very old browsers
- App defaults to dark mode if system preference unavailable
- Theme toggle still works even if system detection fails
- localStorage unavailable = no persistence but toggle still functions

**Expected Compatibility:**
- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support
- Safari (iOS/macOS): Full support
- Older browsers: Graceful degradation to dark mode default

---

## 10. Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issues

None identified.

### Non-Critical Issues

None identified.

### Recommendations for Future Enhancements

While the current implementation is complete and excellent, future enhancements could include:

1. **Additional Theme Variants** (mentioned in spec as out of scope)
   - Sepia mode for reduced eye strain
   - High contrast mode for accessibility
   - Per-category color customization

2. **Advanced Preferences**
   - Scheduled automatic theme switching (auto-dark at night)
   - Theme presets based on character class
   - Export/import theme preferences with CSV

3. **Enhanced Animations**
   - Animated icon transitions between sun/moon
   - More sophisticated fade effects between themes
   - Particle effects on theme change

4. **Analytics**
   - Track theme preference usage
   - Monitor system vs manual preference ratios
   - Measure user engagement with toggle feature

However, none of these are needed for the current spec - they are purely optional future considerations.
