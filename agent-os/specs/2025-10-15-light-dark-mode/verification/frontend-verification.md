## Browser Verification

**Note:** Browser verification with Playwright was not performed as Playwright tools were not available in this verification session. However, the implementation was verified through:
1. Code review of all implementation files
2. Verification of test file results
3. Structural analysis of HTML/CSS/JavaScript integration

**Pages/Features Verified via Code Review:**
- Main application page (`index.html`): ✅ Theme toggle button present in header
- Theme toggle functionality: ✅ Implemented correctly with event listener
- CSS styling: ✅ Complete with transitions and responsive design
- JavaScript theme management: ✅ Fully implemented with proper initialization order

**User Experience Observations (Based on Code Review):**
- Theme toggle button is positioned in header alongside offline status indicator
- Button displays moon icon (☽) in light mode and sun icon (☀) in dark mode
- Theme preference persists in localStorage across page reloads
- System preference is respected on first visit when no manual preference exists
- Smooth 250ms transitions apply when switching themes

**Quality:** Excellent

**Strengths:**
- Semantic HTML using `<button>` element
- Proper ARIA labeling with German text "Theme umschalten"
- Header structure maintains existing elements without breaking changes
- Service Worker cache version incremented to v10 (forces client updates)
