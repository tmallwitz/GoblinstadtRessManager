- Task Group 4.3: 4 tasks (code review) - ACCEPTABLE

All task groups have 3-6 tasks each (optimal range per spec requirements).

**Reusability References:**
- Tasks.md line 632: Notes DRY principle - "Reuses existing functions (getCategoryTotal, getRemainderClass, getResourceIcon)"
- Task 2.1.3 (line 157): Explicitly calls to reuse existing getRemainderClass() function

- PASSED: Complete traceability chain

**Scope:**
- No tasks for features not in requirements
- All tasks address the 2 critical bugs identified
- No scope creep detected
- PASSED: Perfect scope alignment

**Visual Alignment:**
- Task 3.1.1 (lines 240-251): Explicit visual verification for all 4 tabs

- Specifically checks: Zauberhut (wizard hat) - from Screenshot 155611.png
- Specifically checks: Mörser (science/flask), tab emblem (potion) - from Screenshot 155640.png
- Specifically checks: Rüstung (vest), Kettenringe (chain link), Schleifstein (build) - from Screenshot 155720.png
- PASSED: Visual files referenced in verification tasks

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check
PASSED - Appropriate for bugfix, no over-engineering

**Unnecessary New Components:**
- NONE - Only one new function created: updateResourceDisplay()
- This function is necessary because no selective update mechanism exists
- Spec.md lines 88-93 justifies why new component is required
- JUSTIFIED: Cannot reuse renderUI() as it clears entire container (requirements.md line 54)

**Duplicated Logic:**
- NONE detected
- New updateResourceDisplay() function REUSES existing logic:
  - getRemainderClass() - line 219 in spec.md
  - getCategoryTotal() - line 225 in spec.md
  - getClassColor() - line 269 in spec.md (for sparkles)
- Stack generation logic IS duplicated from createResourceCard() (lines 211-221)
- JUSTIFIED: Must rebuild stacks display independently without recreating entire card

**Missing Reuse Opportunities:**
- NONE - This is a bugfix project
- Requirements.md line 82: Correctly states "No similar features were identified for reuse"
- All existing helper functions are properly reused in new code
- PASSED: Appropriate reuse for bugfix context

**Justification for New Code:**
- Spec.md lines 88-93: CLEAR justification
  - "Required because current architecture calls renderUI() which clears entire container"
  - "Cannot reuse existing code as no partial update mechanism exists"
- Tasks.md lines 141-144: Documents why new function is needed
- PASSED: Well justified

**Over-Engineering Concerns:**
NONE detected
- Solution is minimal: Only fixes the 2 identified bugs
- No additional features added beyond requirements
- Icon changes are simple string replacements
- Selective update function is focused single-purpose function
- No complex state management added
- No unnecessary abstractions
- PASSED: Solution is appropriately scoped

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Tech Stack Compliance (tech-stack.md)
- File contains template only, no user-specific tech stack defined
- Project uses: Vanilla JavaScript, localStorage, Service Worker (from CLAUDE.md)
- Spec maintains: Vanilla JavaScript (no framework changes), localStorage (no changes), Service Worker (no changes)
- COMPLIANT: No tech stack changes proposed

### Coding Style Compliance (coding-style.md)

1. **Meaningful Names (line 5)**
   - updateResourceDisplay() - CLEAR purpose
   - getRemainderClass() - CLEAR purpose (existing, reused)
   - getCategoryTotal() - CLEAR purpose (existing, reused)
   - COMPLIANT

2. **Small, Focused Functions (line 6)**
   - updateResourceDisplay() - Single responsibility: update one resource card
   - Spec.md lines 183-234: Function is ~50 lines, focused on selective update
   - COMPLIANT

3. **Remove Dead Code (line 8)**
   - Tasks.md line 199: Explicitly DELETES unused animation trigger
   - Not commenting out, actually removing
   - COMPLIANT

4. **DRY Principle (line 10)**
   - Tasks.md line 632: Documents reuse of existing functions
   - Spec.md lines 80-86: Lists existing code to leverage
   - COMPLIANT

### Test Writing Compliance (test-writing.md)

1. **Write Minimal Tests During Development (line 3)**
   - Zero automated tests proposed
   - Manual testing only (appropriate for vanilla JS PWA with no test framework)
   - COMPLIANT: Zero is the minimum

2. **Test Only Core User Flows (line 4)**
   - Task Group 3.1: Tests core flows (+/- buttons, icon display, animations)
   - Task Group 3.2: Tests critical workflows (CSV, edit modal, persistence)
   - Does NOT test utilities or secondary workflows
   - COMPLIANT

3. **Defer Edge Case Testing (line 5)**
   - Testing focuses on happy path (standard icon display, normal +/- operations)
   - No edge case testing proposed
   - COMPLIANT

4. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation (line 6)**
   - Tests verify: icons display, counts update, animations behave correctly
   - Tests do NOT verify internal function calls or DOM structure details
   - COMPLIANT

5. **Fast Execution (line 9)**
   - Manual tests can be performed in seconds
   - Performance tests use browser DevTools (instant)
   - COMPLIANT

## Critical Issues
NONE

All critical requirements are properly addressed:
- 9 missing icons: Spec provides specific icon replacements for all 9
- Heiler tab emblem: Spec changes to ra-potion (RPG-themed)
- Disruptive re-render: Spec creates selective update function
- Performance target: Spec documents <50ms target with measurement approach
- Animation preservation: Spec explicitly preserves tab-switch and sparkle animations
- Animation removal: Spec explicitly removes fadeSlideIn and count animations from +/-

## Minor Issues

### Issue 1: Requirements.md vs Visual Assets Inconsistency
- **Location:** requirements.md lines 88, 92
- **Problem:** States "No visual assets provided" but 4 screenshots exist in planning/visuals/
- **Impact:** LOW - Spec.md correctly references all 4 screenshots (lines 64-69)
- **Recommendation:** Update requirements.md lines 88-92 to acknowledge the 4 screenshots
- **Workaround:** Spec.md already compensates by properly documenting visuals

### Issue 2: Icon Priority Interpretation
- **Location:** requirements.md lines 27-32, spec.md lines 107-162
- **Observation:** User said "Option C→A→B" priority (RPG Awesome → Material Icons → other)
- **Spec behavior:** Spec recommends specific icons but doesn't always follow strict C→A→B order
- **Examples:**
  - Truhe: Recommends 'fas fa-box' (Font Awesome) instead of checking RPG Awesome first
  - Umhang: Recommends 'fas fa-user-secret' (Font Awesome) instead of checking RPG Awesome first
  - Zauberhut: Recommends 'fas fa-hat-wizard' (Font Awesome) - correct as RPG Awesome doesn't have it
- **Impact:** LOW - Recommendations are still RPG-themed and appropriate
- **Justification:** Spec.md lines 107-162 shows research into what icons exist in each library
- **Note:** This is actually GOOD engineering - spec verified what exists rather than blindly following priority

### Issue 3: Material Icons Format Change
- **Location:** spec.md lines 139, 145, 146
- **Observation:** Introduces new format 'material-icons:iconname' for consistency
- **Requirements:** User didn't explicitly request format standardization
- **Impact:** NONE - This is a maintainability improvement, not scope creep
- **Justification:** Spec.md lines 92-93 justifies: "Required to make Material Icons handling consistent"
- **Assessment:** REASONABLE enhancement within bugfix scope

## Over-Engineering Concerns
NONE

The specification and tasks represent a minimal, focused bugfix:
1. Icon changes: Simple string replacements (9 icons + 1 emblem)
2. Performance fix: One new function (updateResourceDisplay) with single responsibility
3. No new features beyond fixing the 2 identified bugs
4. No complex abstractions or patterns introduced
5. Reuses existing helper functions appropriately
6. Testing approach is manual and focused on core flows

Solution is appropriately scoped and does not over-engineer.

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Update requirements.md visual assets section**
   - Change line 88 from "No visual assets provided" to "4 screenshots provided showing missing icons"
   - Update line 92 to reference the 4 visual files
   - This aligns requirements.md with actual artifacts

### Medium Priority
2. **Add icon priority verification step**
   - In Task Group 1.1, add verification subtask: "Verify recommended icons follow RPG Awesome → Material Icons → Font Awesome priority when available"
   - This ensures implementer checks RPG Awesome first for each icon

### Low Priority
3. **Add performance baseline capture**
   - In Task Group 4.2, add step to capture "before" screenshot showing 350ms response time
   - This documents the improvement more thoroughly

### Optional
4. **Add rollback testing**
   - Consider adding task to verify rollback strategy works (test git reset to checkpoint commits)
   - This ensures rollback plan is executable if needed

## Conclusion

SPECIFICATION VERIFICATION: PASSED

The specification and tasks accurately reflect user requirements and are ready for implementation.

**Strengths:**
- Complete coverage of all 9 missing icons + 1 emblem fix
- Detailed icon research with specific recommendations from existing libraries
- Clear performance fix with selective DOM update approach
- Excellent specificity in tasks (line numbers, code snippets, rationale)
- Comprehensive testing strategy appropriate for manual testing
- Strong traceability from requirements → spec → tasks
- Appropriate reuse of existing helper functions
- No scope creep or over-engineering
- Well-documented rollback strategy
- Compliance with all user standards (coding style, test writing)

**Minor Concerns:**
- Requirements.md incorrectly states no visual assets exist (but spec.md compensates)
- Icon priority not strictly followed in all cases (but justified by availability research)
- Material Icons format change not explicitly requested (but reasonable enhancement)

**Risk Assessment:**
- Low Risk: Icon mapping changes (simple string replacements)
- Medium Risk: Selective update function (new code, DOM manipulation)
- Medium Risk: Modifying updateResource() (touches critical user flow)
- Mitigation: Comprehensive checkpoint commits and rollback plan in place

**Implementation Readiness:**
The specification provides sufficient detail for implementation to proceed. All user requirements are addressed, acceptance criteria are clear, testing approach is defined, and rollback strategy is documented. The minor issues identified do not block implementation and can be addressed during or after implementation as documentation cleanup.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 32/32 resources will display visible, RPG-themed icons (100% coverage)
- +/- button response time will improve from ~350ms to <50ms (85% improvement)
- Tab-switch animations will remain smooth and intentional
- Sparkle effects will continue providing visual feedback
- Zero regressions in existing functionality (CSV, edit modal, persistence, offline mode)

**Sign-off:** Ready for implementation with recommendation to update requirements.md visual assets documentation.
