## Issues Found

### Critical Issues
**None**

### Non-Critical Issues

3. Material Icons "build" icon hardcoded (consistency preference)

All non-critical issues are minor and do not block deployment.

## What Needs Manual Testing

Before deploying to production, a human tester must:

1. Open app in browser at correct viewport (430x932px)
2. Verify all 8 resources visible WITHOUT scrolling on each tab
3. Test animations run smoothly at 60fps
4. Verify icons and emblems render correctly
5. Test offline mode (Service Worker caching)
6. Test CSV export/import with Excel
7. Verify character class theming (gold, purple, blue, red)
8. Test on physical iPhone 16 Pro Max
9. Test on Android Chrome
10. Verify no console errors

**Testing Checklist:** See `implementation/09-testing-results.md`
