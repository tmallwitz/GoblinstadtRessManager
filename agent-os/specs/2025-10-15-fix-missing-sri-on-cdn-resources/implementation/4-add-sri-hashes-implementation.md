# Task 4: Add SRI Hashes to CDN Resources

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #4 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-15-fix-missing-sri-on-cdn-resources/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** ui-designer
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
This task implements Subresource Integrity (SRI) protection for three CDN-hosted icon libraries (Font Awesome, RPG Awesome, and Material Icons) by generating SHA-512 cryptographic hashes and adding them to the HTML link tags along with CORS attributes.

## Implementation Summary
Successfully generated SRI hashes for all three CDN icon libraries using OpenSSL SHA-512 hashing and updated the index.html file to include integrity attributes and crossorigin="anonymous" attributes. This implementation protects the application from supply chain attacks by ensuring that CDN resources are not tampered with - the browser will reject any resources that don't match the provided hash values.

The approach taken follows security best practices by using SHA-512 (the strongest hashing algorithm supported by SRI) and adding the crossorigin="anonymous" attribute to ensure proper CORS handling. Each CDN resource was downloaded, hashed, and the resulting base64-encoded hash was embedded directly into the HTML link tags.

## Key Implementation Details

### SRI Hash Generation Process
**Location:** Command-line using OpenSSL

The SRI hashes were generated using the following process:
1. Downloaded each CSS file from its CDN URL using curl
2. Generated SHA-512 hash using OpenSSL: `openssl dgst -sha512 -binary [file] | openssl base64 -A`
3. Formatted hash as: `sha512-[base64_hash]`

**Generated Hashes:**
- Font Awesome 6.4.0: `sha512-iecdLmaskl7CVkqkXNQ/ZH/XLlvWZOJyj7Yy7tcenmpD1ypASozpmT/E0iPtmFIB46ZmdtAc9eNBvH0H/ZpiBw==`
- RPG Awesome 0.2.0: `sha512-01mG/8rtthZxcE/oLY/1aVBq0UHYxd3r9MgSi33zFQ190gj+BfHY8XeoFiErGyVt1pE68U6InjMq+xkVTSf6yg==`
- Material Icons: `sha512-elM5AP2RRMpGuL4BTMqhieJeSlgasvy9h1aLrm7Xt3+7ULZnCevuXN4l/6OHNS1QvxFMgTyLpy9MLp2o841toQ==`

**Rationale:** OpenSSL provides cryptographically secure hashing that is trusted industry-wide. SHA-512 provides the strongest protection available for SRI.

### Font Awesome CDN Link Update
**Location:** `index.html` line 12

Updated the Font Awesome CDN link from:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css">
```

To:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha512-iecdLmaskl7CVkqkXNQ/ZH/XLlvWZOJyj7Yy7tcenmpD1ypASozpmT/E0iPtmFIB46ZmdtAc9eNBvH0H/ZpiBw==" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

**Rationale:** Font Awesome is heavily used in the UI for category icons and UI elements. Protecting this resource prevents attackers from injecting malicious icons or CSS that could mislead users.

### RPG Awesome CDN Link Update
**Location:** `index.html` line 13

Updated the RPG Awesome CDN link from:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/rpg-awesome/0.2.0/css/rpg-awesome.min.css">
```

To:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/rpg-awesome/0.2.0/css/rpg-awesome.min.css" integrity="sha512-01mG/8rtthZxcE/oLY/1aVBq0UHYxd3r9MgSi33zFQ190gj+BfHY8XeoFiErGyVt1pE68U6InjMq+xkVTSf6yg==" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

**Rationale:** RPG Awesome provides thematic icons specific to the Goblinstadt game context. Protecting this resource maintains the game's visual integrity and user trust.

### Material Icons CDN Link Update
**Location:** `index.html` line 14

Updated the Material Icons CDN link from:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">
```

To:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" integrity="sha512-elM5AP2RRMpGuL4BTMqhieJeSlgasvy9h1aLrm7Xt3+7ULZnCevuXN4l/6OHNS1QvxFMgTyLpy9MLp2o841toQ==" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

**Rationale:** Material Icons may be used for UI controls and actions. SRI protection ensures these icons remain trustworthy.

### CORS Attribute Addition
**Location:** All three CDN links in `index.html`

Added `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute to all three CDN resources.

**Rationale:** The crossorigin="anonymous" attribute is required for SRI to work properly with CDN resources. It tells the browser to make CORS requests without sending credentials, which is necessary for the integrity check to function. Without this attribute, the browser would reject the resource even with a correct hash.

## Database Changes
Not applicable - this is a frontend-only static PWA with no database.

## Dependencies
No new dependencies added. This implementation uses existing CDN resources with added security attributes.

### Configuration Changes
None - no environment variables or configuration files were modified.

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
None - this task does not include automated tests.

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ❌ None (not applicable for static HTML changes)
- Integration tests: ❌ None (testing will be performed by testing-engineer in Task Group 6)
- Edge cases covered: Browser-based verification planned in Task Group 6

### Manual Testing Performed
Manual testing was deferred to the testing-engineer role as specified in Task Group 6. The implementation follows the exact hash generation process specified in the task requirements, and the hashes were generated from the actual CDN resources to ensure accuracy.

**Verification steps for testing-engineer:**
1. Open index.html in browser
2. Verify all icon libraries load without errors
3. Check browser console for no SRI validation errors
4. Check browser console for no CORS errors
5. Verify icons render correctly in UI
6. Simulate tampering by modifying one hash to verify SRI protection works

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Frontend: Accessibility Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/accessibility.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
This implementation maintains accessibility by ensuring that icon libraries load reliably and securely. By adding SRI hashes, we prevent compromised CDN resources from breaking icon rendering, which would negatively impact users who rely on visual cues. The implementation does not alter any semantic HTML or ARIA attributes.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

### Frontend: CSS Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/css.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The implementation adds security attributes to CSS link tags without modifying any CSS code or styling patterns. The SRI hashes protect the integrity of the CSS files loaded from CDNs.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

### Global: Coding Style
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The HTML modifications follow consistent formatting with proper spacing and attribute ordering. Attributes are added in a logical order (href, integrity, crossorigin) for readability.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

### Global: Tech Stack Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
This implementation maintains the existing tech stack (vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3) without introducing new frameworks or dependencies. CDN resources remain on their respective CDNs but are now cryptographically verified.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

### Global: Error Handling
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
SRI implementation includes built-in error handling - if a hash mismatch occurs, the browser will automatically block the resource and log an integrity error to the console. This fail-secure behavior protects users by preventing tampered resources from executing.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

### Global: Validation Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The implementation validates the integrity of CDN resources at the browser level using cryptographic hashes. This is a form of content validation that ensures resources have not been modified in transit or at the source.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

## Integration Points

### CDN Resources
- `GET https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css` - Font Awesome icon library
  - Now protected with SRI hash validation
  - CORS-enabled via crossorigin="anonymous"

- `GET https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/rpg-awesome/0.2.0/css/rpg-awesome.min.css` - RPG Awesome icon library
  - Now protected with SRI hash validation
  - CORS-enabled via crossorigin="anonymous"

- `GET https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons` - Material Icons library
  - Now protected with SRI hash validation
  - CORS-enabled via crossorigin="anonymous"

### Internal Dependencies
This implementation depends on:
- Browser support for Subresource Integrity (all modern browsers support SRI)
- CDN availability for icon libraries (icons will fail to load if SRI validation fails)
- Service Worker cache (Task Group 5) to cache these CDN resources for offline use

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified at implementation time.

### Limitations
1. **SRI Hash Updates Required**
   - Description: If CDN providers update their CSS files (even minor changes), the SRI hashes will become invalid and resources will fail to load
   - Reason: SRI is designed to be strict - any change to the file, even whitespace, will cause a hash mismatch
   - Future Consideration: Documentation in Task Group 6 will provide clear instructions for regenerating hashes when updating CDN resource versions

2. **No Fallback for Failed Integrity Checks**
   - Description: If a CDN resource fails SRI validation, the browser will block it completely with no fallback
   - Reason: This is intentional security behavior - falling back to an unverified resource would defeat the purpose of SRI
   - Future Consideration: Service Worker caching (Task Group 5) provides offline reliability, reducing dependency on CDN availability

3. **Google Fonts CSS Variability**
   - Description: Google Fonts may serve slightly different CSS content based on user-agent or geography
   - Reason: Google Fonts optimizes CSS delivery based on browser capabilities
   - Future Consideration: The hash generated is from the specific response received during implementation; if Google serves different content, the hash may need regeneration

## Performance Considerations
- **Positive Impact**: SRI validation adds negligible overhead (microseconds) during resource loading
- **Neutral Impact**: The integrity and crossorigin attributes add minimal bytes to HTML size (approximately 100 bytes per resource)
- **No Negative Impact**: Browser caching behavior is unchanged; CDN performance benefits are maintained

## Security Considerations
- **Supply Chain Attack Protection**: SRI hashes prevent compromised CDN content from being loaded, protecting users from malicious CSS injection
- **Fail-Secure Behavior**: Resources that fail integrity checks are blocked entirely rather than loaded with warnings
- **CORS Security**: The crossorigin="anonymous" attribute prevents credential leakage while enabling SRI validation
- **Hash Algorithm Strength**: SHA-512 provides strong cryptographic protection against collision attacks

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- **Task Group 5 (Update Service Worker)**: The Service Worker will cache these CDN resources with their SRI attributes intact, ensuring offline integrity validation
- **Task Group 6 (Documentation and Testing)**: The testing-engineer will verify SRI functionality and document the hash generation process for future updates

## Notes
- The generated SRI hashes are version-specific to Font Awesome 6.4.0, RPG Awesome 0.2.0, and the current Material Icons CSS
- If any of these CDN resources are updated to new versions in the future, new SRI hashes must be generated following the same process
- The hash generation process is repeatable and documented in this report for future reference
- All three CDN resources remained on their respective CDNs (not self-hosted) because icon libraries benefit from CDN caching and global distribution, while SRI protection mitigates the security risks
