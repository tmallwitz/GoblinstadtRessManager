## Test 6.5: SRI Validation (Tampering Simulation)

### Objective
Verify SRI correctly blocks resources with incorrect integrity hashes (security verification).

### Prerequisites
- Code editor (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.)
- Browser with DevTools
- Application running on `http://localhost:8000`

### Test Steps

#### Part 1: Tamper with SRI Hash

1. **Open index.html in Code Editor:**
   - File: `Z:\vibe\GoblinstadtRessManager\index.html`

2. **Locate Font Awesome Link (Line 12):**
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css"
         integrity="sha512-iecdLmaskl7CVkqkXNQ/ZH/XLlvWZOJyj7Yy7tcenmpD1ypASozpmT/E0iPtmFIB46ZmdtAc9eNBvH0H/ZpiBw=="
         crossorigin="anonymous">
   ```

3. **Modify Integrity Hash (Change First Character):**
   ```html
   <!-- Change 'i' to 'X' at beginning of hash -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css"
         integrity="sha512-XecdLmaskl7CVkqkXNQ/ZH/XLlvWZOJyj7Yy7tcenmpD1ypASozpmT/E0iPtmFIB46ZmdtAc9eNBvH0H/ZpiBw=="
         crossorigin="anonymous">
   ```

4. **Save File**

5. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - DevTools → Application → Clear storage → "Clear site data"
   - Or: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear cached images and files

6. **Reload Application:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
   - Page will load with tampered SRI hash

7. **Verify SRI Error in Console:**
   - Open DevTools → Console tab
   - Look for SRI integrity error (red text)
   - Expected error format:
     ```
     Failed to find a valid digest in the 'integrity' attribute for resource
     'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css'
     with computed SHA-512 integrity 'iecdLmaskl7CVkqkXNQ/ZH/XLlvWZOJyj7Yy7tcenmpD1ypASozpmT/E0iPtmFIB46ZmdtAc9eNBvH0H/ZpiBw=='.
     The resource has been blocked.
     ```

8. **Verify Resource is Blocked:**
   - DevTools → Network tab
   - Find Font Awesome CSS resource
   - Status should show "blocked:csp" or similar
   - Resource did not load

9. **Verify Visual Impact:**
   - Font Awesome icons should NOT render in UI
   - Example: Icons in category tabs may be missing
   - This confirms resource was actually blocked

#### Part 2: Revert and Verify Fix

10. **Revert Integrity Hash:**
    - Open index.html in editor
    - Change hash back to original:
      ```html
      integrity="sha512-iecdLmaskl7CVkqkXNQ/ZH/XLlvWZOJyj7Yy7tcenmpD1ypASozpmT/E0iPtmFIB46ZmdtAc9eNBvH0H/ZpiBw=="
      ```
    - Save file

11. **Reload Application:**
    - Clear browser cache again
    - Reload `http://localhost:8000`

12. **Verify Resource Loads:**
    - Console shows zero SRI errors
    - Network tab shows Font Awesome CSS with 200 status
    - Font Awesome icons render correctly in UI

#### Part 3: Test Other CDN Resources (Optional)

13. **Repeat tampering test for RPG Awesome:**
    - Line 13, modify integrity hash
    - Verify SRI error appears
    - Verify resource is blocked
    - Revert hash and verify fix

14. **Repeat tampering test for Material Icons:**
    - Line 14, modify integrity hash
    - Verify SRI error appears
    - Verify resource is blocked
    - Revert hash and verify fix

### Expected Results

- ✓ Incorrect SRI hash causes browser to block resource
- ✓ SRI integrity error appears in console with correct format
- ✓ Network tab shows resource blocked
- ✓ Affected icons do not render (visual confirmation)
- ✓ Correct SRI hash allows resource to load normally
- ✓ No errors after reverting to correct hash
- ✓ Icons render correctly after revert

### Security Verification

**This test confirms:**
- SRI is working correctly
- Tampered resources are blocked (security working as intended)
- Browser enforces cryptographic hash validation
- No fallback mechanism exists (correct behavior)
- Security takes precedence over functionality

**Important:** The resource failing to load is the **correct behavior**. SRI is designed to block tampered resources rather than load potentially compromised code.

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Modified SRI hash to incorrect value
- [ ] Cleared browser cache
- [ ] SRI integrity error appears in console
- [ ] Error message includes resource URL
- [ ] Error message includes computed hash
- [ ] Network tab shows resource blocked
- [ ] Affected icons do not render in UI
- [ ] Reverted hash to correct value
- [ ] Resource loads successfully after revert
- [ ] Icons render correctly after revert
- [ ] Console shows zero errors after revert

## Test 6.6: CORS Compatibility

### Objective
Verify `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute does not cause CORS errors when loading CDN resources with SRI.

### Prerequisites
- Application running on `http://localhost:8000`
- Browser with DevTools
- Network connection enabled

### Test Steps

1. **Access Application:**
   - Open browser
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
   - Wait for page to fully load

2. **Verify CDN Resources Load:**
   - Open DevTools → Network tab
   - Filter for "CSS" or "all.min.css"
   - Verify all CDN resources show 200 status:
     - Font Awesome (cdnjs.cloudflare.com)
     - RPG Awesome (cdnjs.cloudflare.com)
     - Material Icons (fonts.googleapis.com)

3. **Check for CORS Errors:**
   - Open DevTools → Console tab
   - Filter for Errors (red icon)
   - Search for "CORS" or "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"
   - Expected: **Zero CORS errors**

4. **Verify crossorigin Attribute:**
   - View page source (Ctrl+U)
   - Find CDN resource links (lines 12-14)
   - Verify each has `crossorigin="anonymous"`:
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="[CDN_URL]"
           integrity="sha512-[HASH]"
           crossorigin="anonymous">
     ```

5. **Test on Desktop Browsers:**
   - Chrome: Verify zero CORS errors
   - Edge: Verify zero CORS errors
   - Firefox: Verify zero CORS errors (if available)

6. **Test on Mobile Browsers (if available):**
   - Chrome on Android: Verify zero CORS errors
   - Safari on iOS: Verify zero CORS errors

7. **Verify CDN Response Headers:**
   - DevTools → Network tab
   - Click on Font Awesome CSS resource
   - Go to "Headers" section
   - Verify response includes:
     ```
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
     ```
   - This header allows `crossorigin="anonymous"` to work

### Expected Results

- ✓ All CDN resources load successfully
- ✓ Browser console shows zero CORS errors
- ✓ `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute present on all CDN resources
- ✓ CDN servers return appropriate CORS headers
- ✓ SRI validation works correctly with CORS
- ✓ No compatibility issues on desktop browsers
- ✓ No compatibility issues on mobile browsers

### Why CORS is Required for SRI

**Technical Background:**
- SRI requires CORS when loading cross-origin resources
- `crossorigin="anonymous"` tells browser to make CORS request
- CDN must respond with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header
- Without CORS, SRI validation fails even with correct hash

**CDN Compatibility:**
- cdnjs.cloudflare.com supports CORS (includes CORS headers)
- fonts.googleapis.com supports CORS (includes CORS headers)
- Most major CDNs support CORS by default

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] All CDN resources load with 200 status
- [ ] Console shows zero CORS errors
- [ ] `crossorigin="anonymous"` present on all CDN links
- [ ] Font Awesome loads successfully
- [ ] RPG Awesome loads successfully
- [ ] Material Icons load successfully
- [ ] CDN response headers include Access-Control-Allow-Origin
- [ ] Tested on Chrome (zero CORS errors)
- [ ] Tested on Edge (zero CORS errors)
- [ ] Tested on Safari (zero CORS errors, if available)

   - Verify path is correct (not missing leading ./)

10. **Check Font File Paths:**
    - Click on each font file in cache
    - Verify URLs start with `http://localhost:8000/assets/vendor/fonts/`
    - Verify file names match: `roboto-regular.woff2`, etc.

11. **Check CDN Resource Paths:**
    - Click on Font Awesome in cache
    - Verify URL: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css`
    - Verify full URL (including https://)

#### Verify SRI Attributes (Console Logging)

12. **Check Service Worker Console Logs:**
    - DevTools → Console tab
    - Look for Service Worker installation logs:
      ```
      [ServiceWorker] Install
      [ServiceWorker] Pre-caching offline page
      [ServiceWorker] Activate
      ```

13. **Verify No Cache Errors:**
    - Console should show zero errors during cache installation
    - All resources should cache successfully
    - No 404 errors for missing files

#### Test Cache Update Behavior

14. **Force Service Worker Update:**
    - DevTools → Application → Service Workers
    - Click "Update" button
    - Service Worker reinstalls
    - Verify cache v5 is recreated

15. **Verify Old Cache Cleanup:**
    - After activation, verify old caches are deleted
    - Only `goblinstadt-cache-v5` should exist
    - No `goblinstadt-cache-v4`, `v3`, `v2`, `v1`

#### Test Cache Serving

16. **Enable Offline Mode:**
    - DevTools → Network → Throttling → Offline

17. **Reload Page:**
    - All resources should load from cache
    - Network tab shows "(ServiceWorker)" for all resources

18. **Verify Cache Hit:**
    - Console logs: `[ServiceWorker] Serving from cache: [URL]`
    - No network requests attempted

### Expected Results

- ✓ Service Worker installs and activates successfully
- ✓ Cache version is v5 (not v4 or earlier)
- ✓ Old cache v4 is deleted during activation
- ✓ All 18+ resources are cached
- ✓ Self-hosted resources cached with correct paths
- ✓ CDN resources cached with full URLs
- ✓ Font files cached correctly
- ✓ No cache errors during installation
- ✓ Cache serves all resources in offline mode
- ✓ Service Worker update recreates cache

### Cache Strategy Verification

**Local Resources (Cache-First):**
- Served from cache if available
- Network fetch only on cache miss
- Fast offline access

**CDN Resources (Network-First with Cache Fallback):**
- Attempt network fetch first
- Fall back to cache if network fails
- Updates cache on successful network fetch

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Service Worker registered successfully
- [ ] Service Worker status: activated and running
- [ ] Cache v5 exists in Cache Storage

- [ ] All 3 CDN resources cached
- [ ] Total 18+ resources in cache
- [ ] Self-hosted resource paths correct
- [ ] Font file paths correct
- [ ] CDN resource URLs correct (full https:// URLs)
- [ ] No cache errors in console
- [ ] Service Worker logs show successful installation
- [ ] Offline mode serves all resources from cache
- [ ] Network tab shows "(ServiceWorker)" in offline mode
- [ ] Console logs show cache hits
- [ ] Service Worker update recreates cache
- [ ] Old caches are deleted on update

## Test Summary

### Overall Test Status

All test procedures have been documented and are ready for manual execution. The application is running on `http://localhost:8000` for testing.

### Critical Test Cases

**Must Pass:**
1. Online mode resource loading (6.2) - Ensures all resources load correctly
2. Offline mode functionality (6.3) - Validates PWA offline-first architecture
3. SRI tampering simulation (6.5) - Confirms security implementation works
4. Service Worker cache behavior (6.8) - Validates cache strategy

**Important Test Cases:**
5. PWA installation (6.4) - Ensures no regression in installation flow
6. CORS compatibility (6.6) - Validates CDN resources work with SRI
7. Visual rendering (6.7) - Confirms no UI regressions

### Test Execution Order

Recommended order for manual testing:
1. Test 6.2 (Online Mode) - Baseline functionality
2. Test 6.8 (Cache Behavior) - Verify Service Worker works
3. Test 6.3 (Offline Mode) - Validate cache serves resources
4. Test 6.7 (Visual Rendering) - Check UI is correct
5. Test 6.5 (SRI Tampering) - Security verification
6. Test 6.6 (CORS Compatibility) - Verify no CORS issues
7. Test 6.4 (PWA Installation) - Final integration test
