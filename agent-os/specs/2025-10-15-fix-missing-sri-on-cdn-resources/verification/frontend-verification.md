### Non-Critical Issues
None identified.

## User Standards Compliance

### Frontend: Accessibility Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/accessibility.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** This security implementation does not modify any UI elements, semantic HTML structure, or accessibility features. All existing accessibility patterns remain unchanged. The self-hosted resources (fonts and CSS) maintain identical visual and functional behavior to the CDN versions, ensuring no accessibility regression.

**Specific Violations:** None

---

### Frontend: Components Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/components.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** No component changes were made in this implementation. The security fix focuses on resource loading and integrity verification without modifying component structure, props, or behavior. Component encapsulation is maintained through proper separation of vendor resources in dedicated directories.

**Specific Violations:** None

---

### Frontend: CSS Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/css.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** The implementation maintains the existing Tailwind CSS methodology without introducing custom CSS overrides. The self-hosted `fonts.css` file follows standard `@font-face` declaration patterns with proper font-family, font-weight, and font-display properties. The implementation "works with the framework's patterns" by preserving the existing Tailwind configuration inline script without modification. No CSS purging changes were needed as the Service Worker cache strategy remains unchanged.

**Specific Violations:** None

---

### Frontend: Responsive Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/responsive.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** This security implementation does not modify responsive design patterns. The self-hosted Tailwind CSS maintains all existing responsive utilities and breakpoints. Font files include proper unicode-range declarations for optimal loading. Touch-friendly design remains unchanged. The implementation follows "performance on mobile" principles by self-hosting critical resources for faster offline loading.

**Specific Violations:** None

---

### Global: Coding Style Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** The implementation follows consistent naming conventions (kebab-case for directories: `assets/vendor/tailwind`, `assets/vendor/fonts`). File organization is logical and focused. The Service Worker update uses clear, descriptive comments for new cache entries. No dead code was introduced. The implementation adheres to DRY principles by reusing the existing Service Worker cache versioning pattern without duplication.

**Specific Violations:** None

---

### Global: Commenting Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** Service Worker updates include clear inline comments explaining the hybrid caching strategy: "CDN Ressourcen (mit SRI geschützt)" and "für selbst gehostete Ressourcen". The fonts.css file includes descriptive comments for each font family and weight. Implementation documentation provides comprehensive rationale for all changes.

**Specific Violations:** None

---

### Global: Conventions Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** The implementation follows consistent project conventions for directory structure (`assets/vendor/`), file naming (kebab-case), and Service Worker patterns (cache version bump, urlsToCache array extension). The font file naming is consistent and descriptive (e.g., `roboto-regular.woff2`, `cinzel-bold.woff2`).

**Specific Violations:** None

---

### Global: Error Handling Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** The Service Worker implementation maintains existing error handling patterns with proper fallback behavior. SRI validation errors are intentionally allowed to fail (security over functionality) as documented. The implementation does not introduce new error scenarios and maintains the existing fetch error handling with cache fallback strategy.

**Specific Violations:** None

---

### Global: Tech Stack Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** The implementation maintains the existing vanilla JavaScript stack without introducing build tools, frameworks, or dependencies. Self-hosting resources aligns with the "no build process" philosophy by keeping deployment simple. The Service Worker remains the sole build-free caching mechanism. All changes work within the existing static PWA architecture.

**Specific Violations:** None

---

### Global: Validation Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** The implementation includes comprehensive validation through SRI hashes (SHA-512) for all CDN resources, which cryptographically validates resource integrity. Self-hosted resources are validated through Service Worker cache installation. Implementation documentation includes validation procedures for future maintenance.

**Specific Violations:** None

---

### Testing: Test Writing Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** The implementation follows the "Minimal Tests During Development" principle by not introducing automated tests for this security fix. Manual testing procedures are documented in Task Group 6 implementation. This approach aligns with "Test Only Core User Flows" by focusing verification on critical security requirements (SRI validation, offline mode, resource loading). The testing strategy is appropriate for a static PWA without a test framework.

**Specific Violations:** None

---

## Service Worker Cache Verification (Static Analysis)

**Cache Version:**
- ✅ Current: `goblinstadt-cache-v5`
- ✅ Previous: v4 (will be deleted on activation per lines 72-81)

**Cache Contents (18 resources):**
1. Core app files (8):
   - `./`, `./index.html`, `./styles.css`, `./app.js`
   - `./manifest.json`, `./icon-192x192.png`, `./icon-512x512.png`, `./sw.js`

2. Self-hosted vendor files (7):
   - `./assets/vendor/tailwind/tailwind-play.js`
   - `./assets/vendor/fonts/fonts.css`
   - `./assets/vendor/fonts/roboto-regular.woff2`
   - `./assets/vendor/fonts/roboto-bold.woff2`
   - `./assets/vendor/fonts/cinzel-regular.woff2`
   - `./assets/vendor/fonts/cinzel-semibold.woff2`
   - `./assets/vendor/fonts/cinzel-bold.woff2`

3. CDN resources with SRI (3):
   - Font Awesome 6.4.0 CSS
   - RPG Awesome 0.2.0 CSS
   - Material Icons CSS

**Caching Strategy:**
- ✅ Local resources: Cache-first (lines 125-178)
- ✅ CDN resources: Network-first with cache fallback (lines 84-123)
- ✅ Aggressive pre-caching during install (lines 35-61)
- ✅ Old cache cleanup on activation (lines 72-81)

---

## Security Verification

### SRI Hash Integrity
- ✅ All 3 CDN resources have SHA-512 integrity hashes
- ✅ All hashes validated against actual CDN content
- ✅ All hashes use proper format: `integrity="sha512-[BASE64_HASH]"`
- ✅ All CDN links include `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute

### Self-Hosted Resource Security
- ✅ Tailwind CSS self-hosted eliminates JavaScript CDN injection risk
- ✅ Font files self-hosted eliminate font CDN dependency
- ✅ Service Worker caches resources after SRI validation (security layer)
- ✅ No fallback mechanism for SRI failures (security over functionality)

### Offline-First Architecture
- ✅ Critical resources (JavaScript, fonts) fully self-hosted
- ✅ All resources pre-cached during Service Worker installation
- ✅ Cache version bump forces all clients to re-download secured resources
- ✅ Hybrid approach: self-host critical, CDN+SRI for icons

---

## File Integrity Summary

**All Files Present and Valid:**
- ✅ `assets/vendor/tailwind/tailwind-play.js` (398KB JavaScript)
