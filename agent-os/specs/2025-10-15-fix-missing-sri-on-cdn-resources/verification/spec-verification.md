### Check 6: Task List Issues

**Test Writing Limits:**
✅ Task Group 6 uses manual testing approach appropriate for static PWA
✅ No automated test suite required (line 267: "No automated test suite")
✅ Focus on critical user flows with acceptance criteria per task group (lines 21-25, 47-53, 86-94, 134-141, 175-183)
✅ Comprehensive manual testing in final task group (lines 190-243)
✅ Testing strategy aligns with standards (lines 264-269)

**Reusability References:**
✅ Task groups reference existing Service Worker patterns (line 145: Task Group 5 dependencies)
✅ No unnecessary new code creation (reusing existing Service Worker lifecycle)

**Task Specificity:**
✅ Each task has clear, specific steps (e.g., Task 2.1: specific URL, save path, verification)
✅ File paths are absolute (e.g., line 35: Z:\vibe\GoblinstadtRessManager\assets\vendor\tailwind\tailwind-play.js)
✅ Line numbers referenced for index.html modifications (lines 38-40, 77-78, 109-111, etc.)
✅ Exact commands provided (e.g., line 104: openssl dgst command)

**Visual References:**
N/A - No visual assets for this security fix

**Task Count:**
- Task Group 1: 6 subtasks ✅
- Task Group 2: 3 subtasks ✅
- Task Group 3: 5 subtasks ✅
- Task Group 4: 7 subtasks ✅
- Task Group 5: 5 subtasks ✅
- Task Group 6: 8 subtasks ✅
Total: 6 task groups with 34 subtasks ✅ (appropriate for security implementation)

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering

**Unnecessary New Components:**
✅ No unnecessary new components - all new directories/files are required for self-hosting
✅ Leverages existing Service Worker cache strategy (line 60)

**Duplicated Logic:**
✅ No duplicated logic - extends existing Service Worker patterns
✅ Reuses existing cache versioning pattern (line 61)

**Missing Reuse Opportunities:**
✅ None - requirements correctly state no similar patterns exist (line 132)
✅ Spec correctly identifies all existing patterns to reuse (lines 59-63)

**Justification for New Code:**
✅ New directories justified: Self-hosting requires local file structure (lines 76-91)
✅ New documentation justified: Maintenance documentation requested by user (lines 155-180)
✅ SRI attributes justified: Security requirement (lines 112-129)

## Critical Issues
None - Specification is ready for implementation

## Minor Issues

### Issue 1: Material Icons CDN URL Inconsistency
**Location:** spec.md line 125-129
**Description:** The spec references adding SRI to Material Icons at line 14 of index.html, but the current index.html shows Material Icons at line 14 is correct. However, the tasks.md references "line 14" for Material Icons (line 124), which will conflict after removing the Google Fonts CSS link at line 15. After the Google Fonts link is removed, Material Icons will no longer be at line 14.

**Impact:** Low - Task execution order will handle this naturally (fonts removal happens in Task Group 3 before SRI addition in Task Group 4)

**Recommendation:** Consider clarifying in tasks that line numbers may shift during implementation

### Issue 2: Font Files Identification
**Location:** tasks.md line 61-64
**Description:** Tasks specify "Roboto: regular (400), bold (700)" but requirements.md line 108 mentions "Roboto and Cinzel families". The original index.html (line 15) only loads Cinzel fonts, not Roboto explicitly.

**Impact:** Low - Roboto is a common system font and may not be explicitly needed

**Recommendation:** Verify whether Roboto fonts are actually used in the application before downloading them

## Over-Engineering Concerns
None - Implementation is appropriately scoped:
- Self-hosting critical dependencies aligns with offline-first PWA architecture
- SRI on CDN resources follows security best practices
- No unnecessary complexity added
- Documentation requirements are reasonable for maintainability

## Standards Compliance Check

### Tech Stack Alignment
✅ Maintains vanilla JavaScript architecture (no framework changes)
✅ Maintains Tailwind CSS (self-hosted instead of CDN)
✅ No changes to existing tech stack

### Coding Style Alignment
✅ No code duplication (DRY principle maintained)
✅ Focused changes (small, specific modifications)
✅ Clean implementation (removes CDN dependencies, no dead code)
✅ No backward compatibility concerns (cache version bump forces clean update)

### Testing Approach Alignment
✅ Minimal tests during development (acceptance criteria per task group)
✅ Focus on core user flows (online/offline modes, PWA installation)
✅ Defers edge cases appropriately (comprehensive testing in final task group only)
✅ Manual testing appropriate for static PWA (no test framework overhead)

## Recommendations

1. **Clarify line number shifting:** Add note in tasks.md that line numbers in index.html may shift during implementation

2. **Verify Roboto font usage:** Confirm whether Roboto fonts are actually used before downloading them (they may be browser defaults)

3. **Consider SRI hash pre-generation:** For faster implementation, consider pre-generating SRI hashes and including them in the spec (optional)

4. **Documentation location:** Consider whether `docs/` is the best location for SRI documentation, or if `agent-os/docs/` would be more appropriate for project-wide documentation

5. **Service Worker testing:** Ensure testing includes Service Worker unregistration/re-registration to verify cache version bump works correctly

## Conclusion

**Ready for implementation with minor clarifications**

The specification and tasks accurately reflect all user requirements from the Q&A session. The hybrid approach (self-hosting Tailwind/fonts, adding SRI to icon libraries) is well-justified and properly documented. The task breakdown is logical, specific, and includes appropriate acceptance criteria at each stage.

The implementation follows security best practices, maintains alignment with the user's tech stack and coding standards, and uses an appropriate manual testing strategy for a static PWA.

The only minor issues are:
1. Potential line number shifting during implementation (easily handled)
2. Unclear Roboto font requirement (verification recommended)

These issues do not block implementation and can be resolved during execution.

**Overall Assessment: APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
