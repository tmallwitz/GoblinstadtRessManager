# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
**Feature: Fix Missing Subresource Integrity (SRI) on CDN Resources**

Security Vulnerability Details:
- Severity: Medium
- Category: Supply Chain Security
- Location: index.html:12-23
- Issue: The application loads 5 external CDN resources (Font Awesome, RPG Awesome, Material Icons, Google Fonts, and Tailwind CSS) without Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes or crossorigin attributes.

Problem:
This allows potential supply chain attacks if any CDN provider is compromised, with malicious content persisting through the Service Worker cache. An attacker who compromises a CDN could inject malicious JavaScript into CSS/JS files that would be cached by the Service Worker and persist across sessions.

Proposed Solution:
1. Add SRI integrity attributes and crossorigin="anonymous" to all CDN resources
2. Consider self-hosting critical dependencies to eliminate CDN dependency entirely (given the PWA/offline-first nature of the application)

Example fix:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css"
      integrity="sha512-iecdLmaskl7CVkqkXNQ/ZH/XLlvWZOJyj7Yy7tcenmpD1ypASozpmT/E0iPtmFIB46ZmdtAc9eNBvH0H/ZpiBw=="
      crossorigin="anonymous">
```
